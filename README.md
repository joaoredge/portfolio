# Joao Renato Portfolio

Iâ€™m a senior full-stack developer with 7+ years of experience building secure, scalable web and mobile platforms across fintech, healthcare, hospitality and SaaS. From early-stage startups to large enterprises, Iâ€™ve led projects from idea to productionâ€”owning frontend, backend, and DevOps pipelines with a focus on performance, security, and clean architecture.

At BetterWorld Technology, I led the development of secure financial interfacesâ€”implementing multi-currency workflows, user onboarding flows, and real-time transaction dashboards. I built resilient systems with strict compliance, automated deployments, and integrated observability stacks to ensure uptime and traceability.

Prior to that, I worked at Visionnair in Europe, where I developed healthcare systems for hospitalsâ€”designing patient data flows, access control, clinician tools, and modular microservices supporting care unit deployments. I also helped digitize medical records and automate reporting pipelines to reduce administrative overhead.

My cross-platform mobile experience includes building React Native apps with biometric login, push notifications, and background sync. Iâ€™ve implemented unified codebases that deliver consistent experiences across Android, iOS, and web.

DevOps is part of my daily toolkitâ€”setting up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, CircleCI), Docker-based environments, and cloud infrastructure (AWS, Vercel, Supabase, Firebase). I design systems with automated testing, rollback support, and performance monitoring from day one.

I thrive in both fast-paced startup environments and larger-scale systems where robustness matters. I bring deep technical ownership, strong product sense, and a collaborative mindset to every team I join. Open to full-time or contract roles where I can help shape high-impact software.
